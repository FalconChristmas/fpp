========================================================================

The software included with the Falcon Player (FPP) and in the FPP
git repository at https://github.com/FalconChristmas/fpp is covered
under several licenses as listed below.

LGPL Components (see LICENSE.LGPL)

    The core of FPP is contained in libfpp.so and all *.c and *.cpp
    files which are compiled to generate libfpp.so are covered under
    the LGPL v2.1 License, or (at your option) any later version.
    You should have received a copy of the LGPL in a file called
    LICENSE.LGPL.  The complete list of the *.o object files compiled
    from these source files can be found in the following makefile
    include files:

    src/makefiles/fpp_so.mk
    src/makefiles/platform/*.mk
    - *.c and *.cpp source for *.o objects in OBJECTS_fpp_so

    src/makefiles/platform/*.mk
    - *.c and *.cpp source for *.o objects in OBJECTS_GPIO_ADDITIONS

3rd-Party Component Licenses (see LICENSE.external)

    Certain Open Source external components are included as part of the
    FPP repository.  The licenses for these external components are
    listed in the LICENSE.external file.

GPL Channel Outputs (see LICENSE.GPL)

    FPP Channel Outputs are normally compiled as separate shared libraries
    which are loaded into the fppd daemon at run time.  The Channel Outputs
    included in the "src/channeloutput" directory are covered under the
    GPL v2 License, or (at your option) any later version.  A copy of the
    GPL v2 should have been included in the same directory as this file
    and called LICENSE.GPL.

CC-BY-ND Components (see LICENSE.CC-BY-ND)

    Several components of FPP are covered by the CC-BY-ND license.  This
    license allows the software to remain Open Source while preventing
    modified copies of certain files to be distributed.  If a file is
    covered by the CC-BY-ND license:
      - you may use the file for any purpose, including commercial
      - you may modify the code for your own use
      - you may NOT distribute any modified copy of the code OR any
        work created using a modified copy of the code.

    The components of FPP which are covered under the CC-BY-ND license
    include all files under the src/non-gpl directory, including but
    not limited to the following:

    - src/non-gpl/capeutils/CapeUtils.h
    - src/non-gpl/capeutils/CapeUtils.cpp
    - src/non-gpl/BBB48String/BBB48Strings.h
    - src/non-gpl/BBB48String/BBB48Strings.cpp
    - src/non-gpl/BBB48String/*.asm
    - src/non-gpl/BBShiftString/BBShiftString.h
    - src/non-gpl/BBShiftString/BBShiftString.cpp
    - src/non-gpl/BBShiftString/*.asm
    - src/non-gpl/DPIPixels/DPIPixels.h
    - src/non-gpl/DPIPixels/DPIPixels.cpp
    - src/non-gpl/FalconV5Support/*

    The Falcon Player developers, Dan Kulp and Chris Pinkham, retain
    sole Copyright to all files under the non-gpl directory structure
    including any user-submitted bugfixes or other modifications.

    In the event that Dan and Chris both abandon the FPP project and
    do not make any commits to the source repository for a period of
    one year, the FPP components covered by the CC-BY-ND license
    revert to the GPL license and are no longer covered by the CC-BY-ND.

GPL Components (see LICENSE.GPL)

    Unless covered by one of the above examples, all other code in FPP is
    licensed under the terms of the GPL; either v2 of the License, or (at
    your option) any later version.  A copy of the GPL v2 should have been
    included in the same directory as this file and called LICENSE.GPL.

    The FPP developers have granted a special exception to the GPL license
    which allows the FPP executable binaries to be linked against and/or
    dlopen() non-GPL libraries which are FPP-compatible Plugins and Channel
    Outputs libraries.  For specific wording related to this, see the
    included LICENSE.exception file.
