# FPP - Falcon Player

The Falcon Player (FPP) is a lightweight, optimized, feature-rich sequence player designed to
run on low-cost Single Board Computers (SBC). It was originally created to run on the $35
Raspberry Pi, hence the middle 'P' in the short name but now the FPP supports many more
systems. It is still mostly commonly used on a Raspberry Pi (Zero, 2, 3, 4) or a Beagle Bone (Black, Green, Pocket).
The FPP shorthand is still used but it is now just called Falcon Player.

FPP aims to be controller agnostic, it can talk E1.31,
DDP, DMX, Pixelnet, and Renard to hardware from multiple hardware vendors. Using various capes, FPP
can also be a controller on P5 and P10 Matrixes, or strings of ws2811 pixels.
