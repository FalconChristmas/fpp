jQuery.msgBox is a plug-in to make smarter displaying messages. Also usage of the plug-in is so easy. You just need to add following files to your page as shown below and the images named 'alert.png', 'confirm.png', 'error.png', 'info.png', 'msgBoxBackGround.png' used by plug-in to 'Images' folder in the root directory.

<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/jquery.msgBox.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<link href="styles/msgBoxLight.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
