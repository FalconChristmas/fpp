<h3>FPP Setting Backup</h3>

<p><b>Backup</b> - Select which settings you want to backup, then hit download. A copy of the backup is also saved in the '/media/config' directory (ie. The USB stick with your sequences).</p>

<p><b>Protect sensitive data</b> - Default checked, removes any sensitive data like passwords from the backup.
    <br>Un-check this if you want to be able make an exact clone of settings to another FPP.
    <br><b>NOTE:</b> The backup will include passwords in plaintext, you assume full responsibility for this file.</p>

<p><b>Restoration</b> - Restoration works the same way, Choose a area to restore, Choose the file json file. You may use the 'Full/All" backup you created and restore any setting from it. Eg restore the schedule only out of a full backup.</p>

<p><b>Keep Existing Master/Slave Settings</b> - Default checked, prevents accidental changing of existing Master/Slave settings. (Useful for cloning settings across devices and keeping existing topology)</p>
