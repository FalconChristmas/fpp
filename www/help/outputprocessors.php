<h3>Output Processors</h2>
The Output Processors page allows adding different types of processing to the channel data prior to the channels being sent to the outputs.  These include:


<h4>Channel Remaps</h3>
<p>Allows output channels to be remapped onto other channels before being sent out to controllers.  This can be use for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying 1 channel of data to another to work around a bad controller port</li>
<li>Copying multiple channels of data to replace a whole controller with another without having to reconfigure the replacement controller with the original controller's start channel configuration.</li>
<li>Duplicating channel data across two or more controllers for instance two identical matrices or pixel trees.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Brightness</h3>
<p>Allows adjusting the brightness and gamma of a range of channels</p>

<h4>Set Value</h3>
<p>Sets the exact value on a range of channels.  This is useful if some channels are not working properly and need to always be set off (possibly a pixel not working correctly) or on (always turn on a tune to sign). </p>

<h4>Reorder Colors</h3>
<p>Change the order of colors for a range of nodes</p>
