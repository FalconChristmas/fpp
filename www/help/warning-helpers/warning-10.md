# Outputting Audio to Dummy device.
FPP could not find an audio device to output to.

Do you mean to have audio/media files on this FPP?  You may have accidentally uploaded them from xLights by ticking the media checkbox.  If so uncheck that and delete the files via the FPP file manager.

Otherwise you can visit the <a href="/settings.php#settings-av">Audio/Video</a> settings page and select an alternative Audio Output Device.

If you have a USB audio adapter and are having problems, you can also try setting a FPP boot delay on the <a href="/settings.php#settings-system">System</a>  settings page.
