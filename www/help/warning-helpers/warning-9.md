# Colorlight receivers not detected
FPP could not detect the firmware version of your Colorlight receiver. If your Colorlight receivers were not powered on and connected when FPP started, you can restart FPPD and FPP will check again.

If this is an ongoing problem, manually select the firmware version on the [channeloutputs.php#tab-LEDPanels](LED Panels) output page.
