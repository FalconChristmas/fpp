NOTE: These are old instructions.  FPP now requires Debian/Raspbian Stretch.
      The master branch of FPP has not been tested on the Pine64.

(incomplete) Instructions for creating a new FPP image for the Pine64
=============================================================================

Download the Debian Jessie image for the Pine64.  This is currently
available from the following URL.

https://www.pine64.pro/downloads/#Debian-Linux

Download the 'Debian Base (3.10.102 BSP 2)' image.

Install the .img file to a SD card (replace 'sdd' with your device):

	SDDEVICE=sdd
	xzcat pine64-image-debianbase-310102bsp-2.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/${SDDEVICE} bs=4M ; sync

# FIXME, need to handle auto resizing of the image here, otherwise the first
# boot script could fill up the whole SD card bloating our download image.
# See /.first_boot and /etc/init.d/aafirstboot script

Boot the SD card on the Pine64

Login to the Pine64:

	Username: debian
	Password: debian

Run the FPP install script:
	wget -O ./FPP_Install.sh http://raw.githubusercontent.com/FalconChristmas/fpp/master/SD/FPP_Install.sh
	chmod 700 ./FPP_Install.sh
	sudo ./FPP_Install.sh

This will install FPP and perform all required changes to the root filesystem
and add the FPP user, install required packages, etc.

Follow the instructions printed at the end of the FPP_Install.sh output to
reboot the system.
