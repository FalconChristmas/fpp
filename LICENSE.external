While the Falcon Player (FPP) is covered under the GPL v2 license as
indicated in the LICENSE file and source code headers, there is some
external code included with FPP that is covered under a different license
due to the license restrictions from the the original authors.  These
external code sources and any license exceptions are noted below.
==============================================================================

fppconvert

fppconvert relies on source code from Matt Brown's xLights which is covered
by the GPL v3.  This means that fppconvert itself is covered by GPL v3.

omxplayer

omxplayer is covered by the GPL v2, but it is included here because we
have a patch to omxplayer to support the MultiSync Video capabilities
in FPP.
