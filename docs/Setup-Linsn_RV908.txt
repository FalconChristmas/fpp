Instructions for setting up a Linsn RV908* LED Panel Receiver card to work
with FPP's LinsnRV9 Channel Output.

NOTE: This has been tested with a Raspberry Pi with the TrendNet TU3-ETG
      USB Gig-E Network adapter.  You can also use a 100Mbit Ethernet
      adapter if you have a Gig-E switch between the Pi/BBB and the LED
      receiver board.

NOTE: These instructions are a work in progress to go along with the new
      Linsn receiver card Channel Output which is also a work in progress.

NOTE: These instructions are currently for supporting 32x16 1/8 scan LED
      panels and may need a modified .con file to support other panel
      scan rates.

- Install the latest version of LED Studio 12.x from

  http://www.linsnled.com/download.html

- Download the following two files and copy to your
  c:\program files\LEDSoft\LEDStudeio\SetData\ directory

  - 32x16 1/8 scan panel config
    http://fpp.bc2va.org/linsn/Linsn-P10_32x16_1-8_scan.rcg

  - Sample 32x16 matrix config (a single 32x16 panel)
    http://fpp.bc2va.org/linsn/Linsn-32x16.con

- Start LED Studio

- Ignore any "Serial port not available" messages unless you are actually
  using a Linsn sender card connected to the PC via the USB port.

- Load the 32x16 matrix config
  - Select the "Hardware Setup" menu entry under the "Option" menu.
  - Enter "168" as the password
  - Click the "Load" button on the popup window and use the file browser to
    locate the previously downloaded Linsn-32x16.con and load it.  This will
	configure LED Studio for a 32x16 display.
  - Click the "Exit" button.

- Enter the software setup screen by selecting the "Software Setup" menu
  entry under the "Option" menu.

- The Width field needs to be set to the length of your longest chain in
  pixels.  If you are using 32x16 panels and have 5 panels on your longest
  chain, then the Width would be 80.

- The Height field needs to be set to the number of outputs in use times the
  height of a single panel.  If you are using 2 outputs of 32x16 panels, then
  the Height would be 32.  You must start at the first output on the board
  and populate them in order.

- Click the "Save Setup" button.

- Go back into the "Software Setup" screen again, but do not enter any fields
  or click any buttons.

- Immediately after entering the Software Setup screen, type the word "linsn"
  on the keyboard.  There will not be any indicator that anything is happening
  until you type the last "n".  As soon as you type the last "n", a password
  prompt will appear.

- Enter the "168" password.

- Ignore any "Serial port not available" and "LED screen system not found"
  messages unless you are actually using a Linsn sender card connected to
  the PC via the USB port.  Click "Cancel" on the "LED screen system not
  found" error popup.

- Click the "Check Hardware" button.  This should scan the network and
  change the "Model" value in the upper right corner to "NetCard" if
  LED Studio can talk to the RV9* receiver card over the network.

- Click the "Custom" button and in the popup box, set the Width and Height
  to the values previously supplied on the Software Setup screen.  Click "OK".

- Click the "Receiver 1" tab.

- Click the "Load from file" button and select the Linsn-P10_32x16_1-8_scan.rcg
  file previously downloaded.

- Change the "Actual Width" and "Actual Height" fields to match the Width and
  Height previously supplied on the Software Setup screen.

- Click the "Send to Receiver" button to send the config to the receiver card.
  After this, you should see a portion of your desktop on the attached LED
  panels.  Note that unless your matrix is configured using one output per
  row, the display may appear jumbled.  This will be corrected by FPP once
  you configure the panel layout in FPP.

- Click the "Save to receiver" button to save the config to the receiver
  card's EEPROM.

- Click "Exit" to exit the Hardware setup screen.

- Click "Close" to exit the Software setup screen.

- Select the "Exit" menu option under the "File" menu to exit LED Studio.

- Your LED Panels should go black after exiting LED Studio.

- You may now disconnect the receiver card from the Windows PC and attach it
  to the FPP system via a USB Gig-E network interface card.

===================

FPP Configuration

NOTE: This is a temporary config method until the UI is updated.

NOTE: These instuctions currently require a second wired ethernet adapter
      to be present in the FPP system.  This interface will be used to talk
      to the Linsn receiver card.

- Configure a LED Panel Matrix via the normal Channel Output UI and save
  the config.  You must use outputs in numerical order, do not skip any
  output numbers for simplicity.  This restriction may be lifted later,
  but you will see better performance if you do not skip any output numbers.

- Hand-edit /home/fpp/media/config/channeloutputs.json and search for the
  "LEDscapeMatrix" or "RGBMatrix" Channel Output.  Change the subType value to
  "LinsnRV9" and save the file and restart fppd.
