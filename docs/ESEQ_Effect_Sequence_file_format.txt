The Effect Sequence file (*.eseq) contains one or more models of contiguous
channels to be overlayed onto the output channel data as an effect.  Each model
defined includes its own start channel and step size.

NOTE: Currently FPP only supports effects files with one model defined.  This
      is also all that xLights/Nutcracker will currently export.  If we decide
	  to start supporting multiple models in a single file, FPP will need to
	  be modified.  This may be necessary to support display features with
	  non-contiguous channels.

The effects file format is as follows:

// Header Information
// Format Identifier
buf[0]  = 'E';
buf[1]  = 'S';
buf[2]  = 'E';
buf[3]  = 'Q';
// Model Count offset
buf[4]  = (wxUint8)1; //Hard coded to export a single model for now
buf[5]  = 0; //Pad byte
buf[6]  = 0; //Pad byte
buf[7]  = 0; //Pad byte
// Step Size (must be a multiple of 4)
buf[8]  = (wxUint8)((stepSize       ) & 0xFF);
buf[9]  = (wxUint8)((stepSize  >>  8) & 0xFF);
buf[10] = (wxUint8)((stepSize  >> 16) & 0xFF);
buf[11] = (wxUint8)((stepSize  >> 24) & 0xFF);
//Model Start address (absolute start channel of model)
buf[12] = (wxUint8)((startAddr      ) & 0xFF);
buf[13] = (wxUint8)((startAddr >>  8) & 0xFF);
buf[14] = (wxUint8)((startAddr >> 16) & 0xFF);
buf[15] = (wxUint8)((startAddr >> 24) & 0xFF);
// Model Size (number of channels in the model)
buf[16] = (wxUint8)((modelSize      ) & 0xFF);
buf[17] = (wxUint8)((modelSize >>  8) & 0xFF);
buf[18] = (wxUint8)((modelSize >> 16) & 0xFF);
buf[19] = (wxUint8)((modelSize >> 24) & 0xFF);
// Begin channel data in rows of 'stepSize' width.
