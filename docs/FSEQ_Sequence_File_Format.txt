v1.0 spec
0-3 - file identifier, must be 'PSEQ'
4-5 - Offset to start of channel data
6   - minor version, should be 0
7   - major version, should be 1
8-9 - fixed header length/index to first variable header
10-13 - channel count per frame
14-17 - number of frames
18  - step time in ms, usually 25 or 50
19  - bit flags/reserved should be 0
20-21 - universe count, ignored by FPP
22-23 - universe size, ignored by FPP
24 - gamma, should be 1, ignored by FPP
25 - color encoding, 2 for RGB, ignored by FPP
26-27 - reserved, should be 0

v2.0 spec
0-3 - file identifier, must be 'PSEQ'
4-5 - Offset to start of channel data
6   - minor version, should be 0
7   - major version, should be 2
8-9 - standard header length/index to first variable header
10-13 - channel count per frame (*)
14-17 - number of frames
18  - step time in ms, usually 25 or 50
19  - bit flags/reserved should be 0
20 bits 0-3 - compression type 0 for uncompressed, 1 for zstd, 2 for libz/gzip
20 bits 4-7 - number of compression blocks, upper 4 bits - introduced in FSEQ 2.1
21  - number of compression blocks, 0 if uncompressed, lower 8 bits.  Total 12 bits.
22  - number of sparse ranges, 0  if none
23  - bit flags/reserved, unused right now, should be 0
24-31 - 64bit unique identifier, likely a timestamp or uuid
numberOfBlocks*8 - compress block index
   0-3 - frame number
   4-7 - length of block
numberOfSparseRanges*6 - sparse range definitions
   0-2 - start channel number
   3-5 - number of channels

(*) The channel count is per frame within this file which may not
be the full number of channels needed to output.  For example, if there
is a single "sparse range" of start channel 5000 with lengh 50, the
channel count in bytes 10-13 will be "50" as there will only be 50
channels per frame within the file.   If there are multiple sparse
ranges, each range is appended one after another into the frame
with the channel count being the total lengths of the ranges.


Variable Length Headers in FSEQ  spec
- v1.0+
  - 'mf' - Media Filename
    vh[0] = low byte of variable header length
    vh[1] = high byte of variable header length
    vh[2] = 'm'
    vh[3] = 'f'
    vh[4-Len] = NULL terminated media filename
  - 'sp' - Sequence Producer
    vh[0] = low byte of variable header length
    vh[1] = high byte of variable header length
    vh[2] = 's'
    vh[3] = 'p'
    vh[4-Len] = NULL terminated string of producer of the fseq file
               ex: "xLights Macintosh 2019.22"
With FSEQ files, the total header length is limitted to 65535 bytes
(two bytes in the headaer for the sequence data offset). This needs
to include all the variable headers, the sparse range table, the
compressed block index table, etc...   Thus, to accomodate larger
and more variable headers, starting in FSEQ 2.2, if the "code" for
the header is ED, the actual data for the header is stored elsewhere.
  - 'ED' - Extended Data
    vh[0] = 18
    vh[1] = 00
    vh[2] = 'E';
    vh[3] = 'D';
    vh[4] = code0 (ex: 's')
    vh[5] = code1 (ex: 'p')
    vh[6-13] = uint64_t offset into the file of the actual data
    vh[14-17] = uint32_t length of header data
Normally, the actual data of for the header is written to the
file immediately after the channel data.
