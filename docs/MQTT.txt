FPP has the ability to both publish status via MQTT as well as receive  commands by subscribing to specific topics.   

Topic Format
---------------------------------------------
{optional prefix}/falcon/player/{hostname}/{sub_topic}

The {optional prefix} is defined in the advanced settings
The {hostname} is defined in the Network Settings tab and should be different for each FPP device on the network.
The {sub_topic} is outlined below...

FPP Publish subtopics
---------------------------------------------
FPP will published the following sub_topics (using the full topic format) if MQTT is configured

*/version -- The current full version of the fpp software
*/branch -- The git branch currently in use
*/status -- Status of the player (idle, playing)

*/playlist/position/status
*/playlist/name/status - Name of current playlist. Can be {null}.
*/playlist/repeat/status - {0 = not repeating current playlist, 1 = repeating current playlist}
*/playlist/section/status - either “New”, “LeadIn”, “MainPlayList”, “LeadOut”, or {null} if nothing playing

*/playlist/sequence/status - Name of current sequence file playing. Can be {null}.

*/playlist/media/title - Title of the audio / video media being displayed
*/playlist/media/status - filename of the current audio/movie

FPP Subscribed subtopics
---------------------------------------------
FPP will listen for these topics if MQTT is configured.  

* playlist/ALLPLAYLISTS/stop/now - Immediate stop all running playlist
* playlist/ALLPLAYLISTS/stop/graceful - gracefully stop all running playlist
* playlist/ALLPLAYLISTS/stop/afterloop.- Allow playlist to finish current loop then stop.


There are also Playlist specific topics. Currently, ${PLAYLIST} is ignored for all but /start and will affect the current running playlist. In the future, when multiple concurrent playlist are running it will affect only the specified playlist.

* playlist/${PLAYLISTNAME}/start - Starts the playlist with the given name. (payload ignored)
* playlist/${PLAYLISTNAME}/next - Forces playing of the the next item in the playlist. (payload ignored)
* playlist/${PLAYLISTNAME}/prev - Forces playing of the previous item in the playlist (payload ignored)
* playlist/${PLAYLISTNAME}/repeat - Sets if the playlist will be repeated or terminate when done. (payload should be 0 or 1)
* playlist/${PLAYLISTNAME}/startPosition - Sets the item in the playlist (zero based) to play next. Does not immediately stop current item . 
* playlist/${PLAYLISTNAME}/stop/now - Forces the playlist to stop immediately. 
* playlist/${PLAYLISTNAME}/stop/graceful - gracefully stop playlist
* playlist/${PLAYLISTNAME}/stop/afterloop - Allow playlist to finish current loop then stop.
