This file lists use of older/deprecated libraries.  At some point,
when we drop support for older OS levels, we can cleanup the code
to use the newer API's exclusively.   For example, Debian Buster
user libgpiod 1.4 but Bullseye used 1.6.1.  When we dropped support
for building on Buster, we should have cleaned up the ifdefs and other
code that allowed continued building/running on Buster.


OpenSSL - Bookworm moved to OpenSSL 3 (from 1.x on Bullseye)
  - CapeUtils.cpp has ifdef to allow continued building on Bullseye


scripts/detect_cape
  - fppcapedetect systemd service now calls fppcapedetect directly so
  this script can be removed after OS level updates install the new
  service file
