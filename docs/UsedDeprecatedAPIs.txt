This file lists use of older/deprecated libraries.  At some point,
when we drop support for older OS levels, we can cleanup the code
to use the newer API's exclusively.   For example, Debian Buster
user libgpiod 1.4 but Bullseye used 1.6.1.  When we dropped support
for building on Buster, we should have cleaned up the ifdefs and other
code that allowed continued building/running on Buster.


OpenSSL - Bookworm moved to OpenSSL 3 (from 1.x on Bullseye)
  - CapeUtils.cpp has ifdef to allow continued building on Bullseye


scripts/detect_cape
  - fppcapedetect systemd service now calls fppcapedetect directly so
  this script can be removed after OS level updates install the new
  service file

scripts/piRTC
  - fpprtc systemdd service now calls fpprtc directly so this script
  can be removed after OS level updates install the new service file

src/boot/FPPINIT.c
  - has a couple of conditionals on GCC >12 in order to generate correct
  config for older FPP7 images.  Can be removed for FPP8 images based on
  Debian 12

scripts/fpp_init
scripts/fpp_start
scripts/fppoled
  - no longer used, can be eliminated
