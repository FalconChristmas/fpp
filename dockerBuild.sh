#to run the image using the local content to override:
# On OSX, it's highly suggested to set an env variable of:
# export DOCKER_MOUNT_FLAG=":delegated"
# Using :delegated will drop the "make" time by almost half.
# However, editing files from OSX may take an extra second
# before the changes are available within the docker container.
